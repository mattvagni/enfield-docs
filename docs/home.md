Enfield is a static-site generator based on pages, it's designed for docs.

You can write your docs in markdown and use your own the theme to customize and design your docs to your liking. You can specify the order of your pages and structure them into sections to make it easy to read.

Enfield also parses your markdown pages and exposes any titles to your theme so that you can offer in page #anchors to your different parts within a page.

Like with any other static site generator, you can deploy it to basically anything since the output is just a bunch of static files.

It has built-in support for publishing to github-pages to make it super easy in a single command.

These docs are generated using enfield, [check it out on Github](https://github.com/mattvagni/enfield-docs).

### Installation
Assuming you already have node and npm installed:
```bash
$ npm install -g enfield
```
You don't have to install it globally but this is probably the easiest option if you just want to try it out.
