Enfield is a static-site generator based on pages, it's designed for docs.

With Enfield you can:
- Write your docs in markdown
- Manually order your pages & organize them into sections
- Completely customize your docs with your own theme
- Easily publish to github pages or anywhere else. 

Additionally Enfield also parses the content of each of your pages and exposes all titles to your theme so you can help the user navigate within each page using `#anchor` links.

Naturally Enfield supports code highlight (via [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)) & the inclusion of any static files (such as images etc.)

## Example
These docs are generated using Enfield, see what they look like on [on Github](https://github.com/mattvagni/enfield-docs).

## Installation
Assuming you already have node and npm installed:
```bash
$ npm install -g enfield
```
You don't have to install it globally but this is probably the easiest option if you just want to try it out.
